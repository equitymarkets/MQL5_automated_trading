# MQL5_automated_trading

Current and future MQL5 code will be pushed here. Please also check out "MQL4_automated_trading" repo for more. 

MQL5 adds to the functionality of MQL4 but is designed for a 64-bit system. It is not an upgrade or update of MQL4 and in many cases is much more complicated. It is, however, faster given that it allows for multi-threading and makes more use of classes. Amongst other things, MQL5 and MT5 contain more timeframes on charts giving them more functionality for complex strategies. 

This folder shows some personal projects that I am working on. Feel free to try them or share. If you would like to collaborate on a project let me know. I have been trading for years but find most strategies fail over a long period of time. If you are more trading oriented, then automated trading can enhance your abilities, but it is not simply a button you can switch on to print money. Disgression and an ability to evolve your style is the only thing that will keep you in business. 

Since this is an ongoing folder do not use without examining and tailoring them to your situation. I will not be responsible for any losses do to use or misuse of the open-source code.

Lastly, make sure you learn about and use magic numbers. 

Enjoy!
